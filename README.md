Custom Items with Locked Interaction &amp; Command Execution

A lightweight Minecraft plugin designed for server administrators to create custom items. These items have a "hard fixation" â€” meaning all default interactions (placing, breaking, using) are blocked. Their sole purpose is to run a configured command when a player clicks with them.

Key Features:

Create Custom Items: Define custom names, lore, and materials for your items.

Locked Interaction: Players cannot place, break blocks, or otherwise use the item as a regular tool or block. This prevents abuse and preserves the item's purpose.

Command Execution: Execute any server command or a sequence of commands when the player right-clicks or left-clicks with the item.
